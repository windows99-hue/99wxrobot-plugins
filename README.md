# 99wxrobot Plugins

This repository is the plugins by myself for [99wxrobot](https://github.com/windows99-hue/99wxrobot).

I will update this repository when I made something new.

## Installation

In this repository, every plugin has their own directory.

To use it, you need to put all of the files in the directory into the `plugins` folder of 99wxrobot.

After that, restart the programm, and check it out.

## Share

If you have your own plugins and you hope to open source it, welcome to send a pull request to me, I will add your plugins into this repository.

Thank you very much.
